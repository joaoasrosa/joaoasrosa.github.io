<p>Today was a debut using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/">GitHub Gist</a>. In one of my GitHub projects, I need a close integration between the Continuous Integration tool (in this case <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a>) and my .NET Core project, specifically inÂ how to update the version of the DLL based on the version in AppVeyor?</p>
<p>To sort out this, I use my Powershell ninja skills to write the script:</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/joaoasrosa/8b3a9681c6153f9abed94af7089b222a</p>
<p>And integrate it with the appveyor.yml before_build event! Simple and do the job!</p>
