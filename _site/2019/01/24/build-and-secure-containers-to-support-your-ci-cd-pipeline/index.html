<meta name="description" content="There are 2 systems in any company that are critical: the payroll system, and the CI/CD system. Why? You may ask...If the payroll system doesn&#39;t work, people will leave the company and the company (may) face legal problems; the CI/CD system is the gateway to production. If it is down and there is a bug in production, it will affect your business; loss of revenue, loss of customers, loss of money, just to name a few.Usually, I find these problems regarding the CI/CD tooling:Poor Software Lifecycle Management, with outdated software, containing critical vulnerabilitiesAncient capabilities in the build agents. In extreme cases, frameworks and tools that are no longer supported by the vendorsDrifting agents. It means that teams had to do some sorcery to get the software buildLack of proper isolation between different builds. It means that a build could access to another build filesLead teams to upgrade or install a new frameworkOutdated and strict rules mandated by a operations team. Usually from people that outdated heuristics on how software should be developedTo tackle these problems, I usually suggest the use of a SaaS solution where they shift the responsibility of maintaining and securing the tool to the vendor; also, I recommend to select a tool which supports containers where the software is built. It can address several of the issues, such as providing isolation and decreasing the lead time to provide new capabilities. Also, it allows teams to create their own containers, shifting the responsibilities of the platform team to the development teams. Using containers as computing unit, it allows for granular capabilities (comparing to the typical full flagged machine), having a cleaner environment based on specific needs.As an added benefit, the platform team is no longer a constraint, since the development teams do not need to request new capabilities for the build/deploy agents. The platform team is responsible for a service provided to the organisation, and the service needs to be stable and secure. It is a paradigm and mindset shift for the typical operations team, which can become a platform team, offering outstanding services to the developers.All boxes ticked! Or not...The pivotal change is shifting the responsibilities of the platform team to the development teams.

It also enables the platform team to be in control without constraint the development teams, and dictate the &quot;holy rules&quot; of &quot;the platform&quot;.

<h2>In conclusion...</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The implementation empowers the development teams to create their own containers to be used in the build environments, without interfering with other teams. It also enables the platform team to be in control without constraint the development teams, and dictate the "holy rules" of "the platform". However, provides the correct level of security controls, since everything is automated, PR's are enforced, and it is possible to know exactly what and when it was used. It makes the auditors lives easier, and creates a safer environment!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you have alternative implementations or ideas, feel free to shout! This implementation uses some tooling, and perhaps you have better alternatives. I will love to discuss it! </p>
