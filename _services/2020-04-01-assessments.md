Knowing where you are is the first step to evolving your organisation. There are different dimensions to consider, and I can do a holistic assessment. Or I can focus on a specific topic, such as Team Topologies, SRE or Software Architecture.

### Holistic assessment

I perform holistic assessments of your organisation. An assessment can be done over 5 to 7 weeks, focusing on different dimensions that contribute to a high-performing organisation. As example:

- **Strategy execution** - is your strategy supported by your operating model?
- **Organisational model** - are your organisational structure and practices fit for purpose?
- **Product & architecture effectiveness** - what is the alignment of product management and software architecture?
- **Software, data & infrastructure delivery** - do your software, data & infrastructure delivery allow fast flow?
- **Business value optimisation** - are you delivering value to the market potential?
- **Cultural practices** - are your cultural practices promoting a healthy organisation?

At the end of the assessment, you will have a holistic view of several dimensions and how they interact. It will contain actionable insights which you can implement in different time horizons.

### Area assessment

Together with our holistic assessment, I also perform a specific assessment in some knowledge areas:

- Organisational model
- Software design & architecture
- SRE & DevOps
- Platform Engineering
- Product Engineering

The area assessments focus on a specific knowledge area. They will provide insights for a subset of your organisation, allowing you to move quickly.
