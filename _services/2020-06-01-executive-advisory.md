The world is in constant evolution, and executives are facing thought challenges. I bring my experiences from the field, in which you can use the patterns and heuristics to your context.

### Tailored executive advice

Each organisation is unique, and the same applies to its executive team. I advise executives who are prepared to break the current status quo and prepare their organisations for the challenges of tomorrow. I have my roots in the technology space and acquired experience in all the dimensions of an executive team. Every decision has ramifications and crosses different departments and organisational units. OMyur advice takes into consideration your unique context.

### Advise within your executive team or your advisor

My executive advisory service has two flavours: advise an executive team, or be an advisor of one executive. You chose what fits best!
