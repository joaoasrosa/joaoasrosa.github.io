leadership vs management
- why we need both
- my shorfalls

values
- courage
- honesty
- transparency
- empathy
- compassion

principles
- speak out
- fearless opinion
- string opinion, weak held
- open door
- threat with justice

practices
- pairing
- shadowing
    allows to meet people. braking the ice is easier, and way less formal than an introduction. Plus, go into content, wihtin context.
- meeting as campfires
- check-in and check-out
- rotate (assignments, roles, teams)
- sharing (information, knowledge) -> task forces, community of practices (internal focus); meetups, conferences (external focus)
- be intentional, reveal your intention
    namely with async communication. Inspired by basecamp
- listen to understand, rathen than to reply
