<p>In my previous <a href="http://joaorosa.io/2018/05/21/life-of-a-c-developer-how-to-build-and-test-an-aws-lambda-locally/">blog post</a>, I developed a real-life example of how we can develop AWS Lambda locally. For a developer is very powerful to have a development environment which is a replica of the production environment. However, we should have a same CI/CD pipeline, where we build and test our solution.</p>
<p>Today I will show how to configure TravisCI in order to build and test our C# AWS Lambda.</p>

<h2>TravisCI</h2>
<p>TravisCI is one alternative for our CI/CD pipeline. It is Linux based and free for open source projects.</p>
<p>To configure our pipeline for the AWS Lambda we need to create the file<code>.travis.yml</code>, containing the Pipeline as a Code (PaaC) instructions.</p>
