As a manager, it's your job to create an environment where teams can thrive and deliver value in complex environments. In this interactive workshop, you'll learn how to apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to nurture team interactions and drive successful outcomes. We'll explore key DDD principles and combine them with Team Topologies. You will learn the importance of boundaries in complex systems. We will use visual collaboration tools like Core Domain Charts, Context Maps and Wardley Maps to understand how to create an environment for people to apply DDD. No prior DDD experience is required.

## About the workshop
As a manager, you know how challenging it can be to navigate complexity and deliver value in a fast-paced, constantly changing environment. That's where Domain-Driven Design (DDD) can help. DDD is a holistic approach to designing systems that focuses on the core business domain and models its interactions. By understanding and applying DDD principles, you can create an effective and adaptable environment and support teams in defining the boundaries of their domain.

Effective communication and teamwork are also critical for the success of any project. Still, it can be challenging to facilitate these when there are multiple stakeholders or team members who have different backgrounds and expertise. DDD can help you establish clear boundaries and build a shared understanding of the domain, improving communication and collaboration. You'll learn how to use visual collaboration tools like Core Domain Charts, Context Maps, and Wardley Maps to identify and manage boundaries with your teams and how to apply the Team Topologies patterns to support fast flow. In this interactive workshop, you'll have the opportunity to practice using these tools and learn how to apply DDD in your context.

## What you will learn
- Understand DDD's key principles and concepts and how they can be applied to complex environments.
- Learn how to use visual collaboration tools like Core Domain Charts, Context Maps, and Wardley Maps to identify and manage boundaries with teams.
- Apply Team Topologies patterns to support fast flow and improve effectiveness.
- Understand Conway's Law's role in shaping a system's structure and an organisation's communication patterns.
- Acquire the skills and knowledge to start applying DDD in your organisation to create the conditions for high-performing teams.

These learning goals focus on the core concepts of Domain-Driven Design, its application in complex environments, and the tools and techniques for applying it in practice. By the end of the workshop, you should have a strong understanding of DDD and how to use it in your organisation.
