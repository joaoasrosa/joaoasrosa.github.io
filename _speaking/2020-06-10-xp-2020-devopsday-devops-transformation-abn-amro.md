title: 'Devops transformation @ ABN AMRO'
description: >
 Many organisations execute IT transformations to be more efficient and effective. However, the context differs between organisations, and there is no blueprint to copy IT transformations across organisations. We need to listen to the signals from inside of the organisation, learn, and adapt. In this experience report, we detail our approach and learning for a DevOps transformation within a bank in The Netherlands. Our most valuable insight is to put people at the centre of the transformation since we work in a knowledge field.
