title: 'EventStorming: Deliberate, Collaborative Learning Between Multiple Disciplines'
description: >
 Creating multiple models for the same problem is one of the more important lessons that domain-driven design teaches you. It’s a lot cheaper to quickly iterate over them and throw away less-useful prototypes before you even start coding. However, creating multiple models can be hard. When you begin gaining insight from your domain, you may suffer from cognitive biases that get in your way to gain new insights. You need these insights before you even start thinking about modeling. Tools like event storming can help you to deliberately discover and battle these biases. They help you quickly gain insight into the problem space.
 <br />
 <br />
 Kenny Baas-Schwegler and João Rosa explore the essentials of event storming and how it can help you gain the necessary insights to deliver quality software. With your newly acquired domain knowledge, you can start modeling multiple models for the same problem with domain-driven design patterns. This way of visualizing gives you the power to quickly iterate over different models and figure out which will be the best to use. You’ll leave with the confidence to start your coding journey in test-driven development (TDD) style.
