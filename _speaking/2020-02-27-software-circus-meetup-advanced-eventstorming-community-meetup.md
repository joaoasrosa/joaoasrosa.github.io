title: 'Advanced EventStorming community workshop'
description: >
 Creating multiple models for the same problem is one of the more important lessons that Domain-Driven Design teaches us. It is a lot cheaper to quickly iterate over them and throw away less useful prototypes before we even start coding. However, the way agile software teams gain knowledge about what to build is either by the product owner or business analyst serving as a proxy to domain knowledge. Domain knowledge usually ends up as second-hand news in either functional design documents or as user stories in some scrum tools like Jira. Second-hand knowledge is a significant risk when building software. Each time information is transferred just like doing the telephone game, the story is changed, and people make assumptions. Because as Alberto Brandolini said: ''It is not the domain expert''s knowledge that goes into production; it is the developer''s assumption of that knowledge that goes into production''.
 <br />
 <br />
 Sharing knowledge is way more effective if we actively collaborate to gain new insights about the problem at hand. There are a lot of tools available to achieve it, but they have a steep learning curve, resulting in most disciplines having their own tool to model in. To solve it, we need visual collaborative modelling to learn between multiple disciplines. EventStorming is a technique that can facilitate visual collaborative modelling between the different disciplines. It is easily learned and empowers continuous knowledge sharing without the need to know a tool.

 <br />
 In this workshop, you will learn the essentials of EventStorming and how it can help you gain the necessary insights you need to deliver quality software. With our newly acquired domain knowledge, we can start modelling multiple models for the same problem with the Domain-Driven Design patterns. This way of visualising gives us the power to quickly iterate over the different models and figure out which will be the best to use. You will end up with the confidence to start your coding journey TDD style!
