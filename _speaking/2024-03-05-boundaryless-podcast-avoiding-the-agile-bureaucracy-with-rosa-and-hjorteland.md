title: 'Avoiding the Agile Bureaucracy with Rosa and Hjorteland'
description: >
 In today’s episode, we are joined by João Rosa and Trond Hjorteland, two organizational consultants with a unique point of view, who take us through the depth of Open Systems Theory, and what it means to be socio-technical practitioners, passionate about transitioning democratic organizations to fast-flowing operational models. 
 <br /><br />
 With many years of experience in large and complex contexts, they delve into what it means to create a collaborative and democratic organization, and how to balance mission, business outcomes, and cognitive load.
 <br /><br />
 Join us on this episode, as we debate the role of “purpose”, entrepreneurship, and autonomy and learn how to avoid the creation of agile bureaucracies.
 <br /><br />
 Tune in, and get inspired.
 <br /><br />
 In the conversation with Rosa and Hjorteland we started from an original question that Simone threw out at a small conference recently:: how do we avoid building Agile Bureaucracies? 
 <br /><br />
 What does it mean to develop a business that achieves agility without having to exert total control on flows and processes?
 <br /><br />
 With increasingly complex and dynamic environments, it becomes pivotal for organizations to recognize and adapt to change, if not stay ahead of it and rigidities are more than dangerous - even the cultural ones.
 <br /><br />
 Emphasizing learnings from different methodologies like Open Systems Theory, Domain Driven Design, and Team Topologies; our guests advocate a team-centered, and democratic approach over industrial and hierarchical practices. 
 <br /><br />
 A unique episode to look out for.
