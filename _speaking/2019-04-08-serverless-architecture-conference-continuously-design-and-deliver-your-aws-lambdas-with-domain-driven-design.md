title: 'Continuously design and deliver your AWS Lambda’s with Domain-Driven Design'
description: >
 Serverless functions give us the power to fail faster, and more often. Since there are no servers to manage, you can create isolated, production-like environments much quicker. Because of this, it will be easier to develop and run pipelines which will run faster and more stable. You will gain the needed feedback much faster.
 <br />
 <br />
 However, giving the natural small size of functions, within no time we will have thousands of them running. Managing this will soon slow us down, and we can get lost in translation with our business. We will lose the fast feedback that was promised.
 <br />
 <br />
 Join us in this workshop where we leverage the Bounded Context pattern from Domain-Driven Design. We will design the boundaries using EventStorming, leverage Test Driven Development to code our AWS Lambdas, and use GitLab with SAM and CloudFormation to continuous testing and continuous delivery of our application. So if you don’t want to make a mess of all your lambda’s, and want your models to stay connected with the way the business thinks about them, this is the perfect workshop for you!
