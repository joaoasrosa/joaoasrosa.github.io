title: 'From EventStorming to CoDDDing with the model exploration whirpool'
description: >
 To really understand what our users need so that we can build the right thing, we want to have a first-hand experience of 'real-life stories' before we model and create our software. To quote Alberto Brandolini "it is not the domain expert's knowledge that goes into production, it is the developer's assumption of that knowledge that goes into production". Visual collaboration are tools that minimize assumptions by engaging in collaborative deliberate learning across different disciplines. This helps to solve complex business problems in the most effective way.
 
 Although the learning of the domain helps us to understand the domain better, visual collaboration tools like EventStorming and Example Mapping can be quite an overwhelming experience. Developers can be left with the question of how to turn a few stickies or index cards into working code.
 
 Join us in this talk where we will leverage Eric Evans model exploration whirlpool. During a live EventStorming and Example Mapping software modelling session, we will show how with that outcome you can leverage Responsibility Mapping to propose a model with Domain-Driven Design patterns. It will ultimately result in coding by doing outside in Test Driven Development! You will leave with the knowledge to go from visual collaborate modelling to coding while refining your ubiquitous language.
