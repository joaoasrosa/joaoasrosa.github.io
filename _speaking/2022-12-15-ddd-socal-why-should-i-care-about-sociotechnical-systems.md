title: 'Why should I care about sociotechnical systems?'
description: >
 The craft of a software design, architecture and engineering is in constant change. Technology evolves, and our skills and practices evolves as well. How about the teams we are part of? And the organisations? The evolution at the team and organisation level is slower but more disruptive. Our brain likes routine, and it is hardwired that way. However, everything around us evolves.
 <br/><br/>
 How do all of those dimensions play together? How can we thrive in our craft? As software designer, architect or engineer, we should also be aware of the implications of technology changes in the teams and the organisation. We work in sociotechnical systems, and we create sociotechnical systems. It sounds like the movie Inception, doesn't it?
 <br/><br/>
 Join me in this talk, where I will share my insights on the skills need to design sociotechnical systems and how we, as a community, can learn from each other.
