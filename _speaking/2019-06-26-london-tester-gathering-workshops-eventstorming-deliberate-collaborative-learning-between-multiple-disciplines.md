title: 'EventStorming: Deliberate, Collaborative Learning Between Multiple Disciplines'
description: >
 To understand what our users need to build and test the right thing, we want to have a first-hand experience of ‘real-life stories’ before we can model, test and create our software. To quote Alberto Brandolini ‘it is not the domain expert’s knowledge that goes into production, it is the developer’s assumption of that knowledge that goes into production’. EventStorming is a technique that uses visualisation to minimise assumptions by doing deliberate, collaborative learning between multiple disciplines.
 <br />
 <br />
 In this session, we will experience hands-on the basics of EventStorming. Incrementally showing you when and how you can use it, and how it can help you to upgrade your teams' refinements. Eventually, we can create specifications by example that can drive to deliver our tests and code. You will learn how EventStorming can help teams to improve collaboration, decrease assumptions and biases and creating better quality software by building the right thing.
