title: 'Introduction to the Domain-Driven Design tactical patterns with outside-in Test-Driven Development'
description: >
 Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is becoming popular within the software engineering industry. However, we have other practices that can be used as well. How does everything fit together? During this webinar we will do a live coding session. We will walk you through an existing codebase, refactor it using outside-in Test-Driven Development (TDD) while applying DDD tactical patterns to express our intention in code. We will end with a few practical tips and tricks that you can start to apply tomorrow.
