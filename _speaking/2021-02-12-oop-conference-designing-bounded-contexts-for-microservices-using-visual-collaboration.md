title: 'Designing Bounded Contexts for Microservices Using Visual Collaboration '
description: >
 There is an industry trend where businesses are moving towards autonomous product teams. These teams aim to be end-to-end responsible for the product they are building and maintaining. With the help of Continuous Delivery, teams have faster feedback cycles in which they can probe if a certain feature works. To achieve end-to-end team autonomy, companies move towards a microservices architecture to successfully inspect and adapt. To be effective with a microservices architecture, we require Conway's alignment, engineering teams aligned to business models/products; to achieve Conway’s alignment it’s required to design and model the domain. Domain-Driven Design’s bounded context is the essential pattern that helps to create Conway’s alignment.
 
 Join us in this hands-on session where we show you how visual collaboration is the most effective way in co-creating sustainable Conway’s alignment. We will distil bounded contexts with visual collaboration tools Big Picture EventStorming, Context Mapping and the Bounded Context Canvas.
 
 With visual collaboration:
 
 - We create a shared understanding of the business flow, uncovering inconsistencies and competing goals
 - Using the Theory of Constraints, we can discover, highlight and create a shared vision and strategy to focus our effort
 - A critical part of doing visual collaboration is effective facilitation, especially facilitating workshops with +30 people at the same time
 You leave our session understanding that to be effective with microservices, you need to start discover and design bounded contexts. You will learn heuristics that guide you in using visual tools in specific situations, and how to move on towards microservices.
