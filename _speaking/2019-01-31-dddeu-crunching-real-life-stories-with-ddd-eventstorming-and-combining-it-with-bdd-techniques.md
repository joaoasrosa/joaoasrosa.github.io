title: 'Crunching ''real-life stories'' with DDD EventStorming and combining it with BDD techniques'
description: >
 To really understand what our users will need, we want to have a first-hand experience from 'real-life stories' before we can model and create our software. While both the DDD and BDD techniques emphasis on ‘real-life stories’ by doing collaborative deliberate learning, they both focus on different goals. DDD focuses more on creating bounded contexts in which a single model is created, BDD focuses more on different scenarios and can create executable specifications as an outcome. By doing EventStorming and using techniques from BDD based on feature mapping, such as Example Mapping, we can create more insights. We can simultaneously create a model and executable specifications for our user needs. This way, we can write software and tests which matches the shared understanding of the user, creating a ubiquitous language. Value will be shipped at a faster pace.
 <br />
 <br />
 In this hands-on session, we start with a Process EventStorming. We will use Example Mapping to get more insights into our process. Eventually, I will show you how the outcome can drive our Software Modelling EventStorming and create Executable Specifications. This way we can create a ubiquitous domain language that we can use in our application and test code. You don't need a laptop for this session as the focus is on the discovery phase.
