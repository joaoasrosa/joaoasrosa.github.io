title: 'An enabling approach to an organisation transformation'
description: >
 Organisations attempt to transform their structure in many different ways. Usually, they resort to external help to move the needle forward. More often than one would like, externals impose the new organisation structure on people. Well, you can picture what happens next in the story.
 <br /><br />
 There are different approaches to organisation evolution (as opposed to transformation). Team Topologies give us a pattern language describing the expected behaviours. Namely, how to be an Enabling team. Join Jo√£o in this talk, where he will share his field story about enabling a European Telco in its evolutionary journey. The organisation applied Team Topologies and Domain-Driven Design practices to reshape their boundaries and allow fast flow. Spoiler alert: no design was imposed on the organisation!
