Chaos Engineering is a practice that has its roots at Netflix. The practice born from the challenges of moving their workloads from the datacenter to the cloud; the efemeral nature of the cloud affected the way that they build and operate system at scale. The initial project was call [Chaos Monkey](https://netflixtechblog.com/the-netflix-simian-army-16e57fbab116) and it has almost 10 years.

Since then the community grow, fueled by Netflix practicioners. Today there are commercial and open source tools, and we can see more initiatives in different communities. The technical practices had matured, and the knowledge started to spread in the IT world. 

However, it is deemed perceived as a technical practice. Can we leverage Chaos Engineering as a management practice?

Organisations are in need of managers that take a leadership role in creating *safety* for both individuals and teams.

But what are the practices that can a manager embrace?

#### Dynamic Safety Model and management

The *Dynamic Safety Model* was described by Jens Rasmussen in his paper titled [Risk management in a dynamic society: a modelling problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753597000520). It can be ilustrated by the following picture:
