Chaos Engineering is a practice that has its roots at Netflix. The practice born from the challenges of moving their workloads from the datacenter to the cloud; the efemeral nature of the cloud affected the way that they build and operate system at scale. The initial project was call [Chaos Monkey](https://netflixtechblog.com/the-netflix-simian-army-16e57fbab116) and it has almost 10 years.

Since then the community grow, fueled by Netflix practicioners. Today there are commercial and open source tools, and we can see more initiatives in different communities. The technical practices had matured, and the knowledge started to spread in the IT world. 

However, it is deemed perceived as a technical practice. Can we leverage Chaos Engineering as a management practice?

#### Role of a manager in today's world

The role of a manager has changed. From a prescreptive approach, where the manager is leading the activities of people (managing), towards a supportitive and transformational role. Today a manager needs to give structure and create a safe space for people and teams to excel in their fields.

Organisations are in need of managers that take a leadership role in creating *safety* for both individuals and teams.

But what are the practices that can a manager embrace?

#### Dynamic Safety Model and management

The *Dynamic Safety Model* was described by Jens Rasmussen in his paper titled [Risk management in a dynamic society: a modelling problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753597000520). It can be ilustrated by the following picture:

[Casey Rosenthal](https://twitter.com/caseyrosenthal) and [Nora Jones](https://twitter.com/nora_js) in the book [Chaos Engineering, System Resiliency in Practice](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/chaos-engineering/9781492043850/) summarises the *Dynamic Safety Model* in Economics, Workload and Safety, where software engineers are good into understand the limits and trade-offs with economics and workload, but we often miss the limits and trade-offs in safety. I agree with the analysis, and I learned in my career the same. Sometimes I underestimate my decisions towards safety, and others I overestimate. Which made me to retrospect based on the learnings of the past decade.

I believe that managers can create safety, and coach and mentor engineers to improve their decision making process regarding the safety limits.



... Engineers... What left for the managers?!
