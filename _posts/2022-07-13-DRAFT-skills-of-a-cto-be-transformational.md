Today, most companies have a CTO, even if the position has a different title. The responsibilities, accountabilities and expectations of the job also vary per company; there is no singular definition of a CTO. What I see in the software and technology industry is a convergence of the skills of a CTO - communication and technology vision are frequently mentioned as critical skills. Werner Vogels wrote a [blogpost](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/07/the_different_cto_roles.html) where he describes the history of the CTO role and the different CTO archetypes.

From my experience as interim CTO and consultant, I have observed an emerging pattern in the industry. Given the critical role of software and data in an organisation's strategy, the organisation will have a competitive advantage if the CTO also has **transformational skills**. It becomes more apparent in digital-native companies whose business model is centered on selling a digital product powered by software.

The concept is not new. In the book Accelerate, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim and Jez Humble refers that in high-performing organisations, leadership needs to be transformational instead of servant leadership. (Please note that those are my own words, I'm a bit far away from home, and I don't have a copy of the book at hand). They explore the premise that a high-performing organisation needs to be in constant evolution since the user needs to shift, and transformational leadership can give direction, guiding the organisation's development.

## But what does it mean?
Maybe it is one of the burning questions. I will give my take on the transformational skill of a CTO from my own experience and observing the market.

First and foremost the ability to **read weak signals**. In short, there are signals before any event (examples of events such as a staff member resigning or an economic downturn, to name two). Those signals can be very subtle (weak) and go almost unnoticed. The ability to capture the signals is the first step in building a transformational skill. With the ability to read weak signals, the power of **makes sense out of those signals**. Just capturing signals is not enough; it is necessary to make sense of it, which is a tremendous challenge since reality is complex and chaotic. Let me be more specific: to be transformational, it is crucial to relate different information. And those relations emerge from the various signals (both strong and weak).

Last but not least, **empathic communication** is vital. Other authors have mentioned communication before, and I want to emphasise the empathic part. A person can communicate with empathy by changing styles, adapting them to the context, and dealing with the different situational nuances. My experiences taught me that using empathy in my communication reinforced relationships, even when the content of the message was not positive.

These qualities will compound the transformational skill of a CTO. *But it doesn't end here*. In a digital-native company, a CTO is privileged to contribute to the organisation's strategy rather than having a supporting role. In a digital-native company, the business proposition is centred on a digital product, and typically it will fall under the responsibility of the CTO. As such, the company's operating model will be critical for its success. An operating model bridges the company strategy to execution and delivery. A misfit in the bridge (the operating model) will limit the execution and delivery capability of the company strategy. The operating model is connected to the size of the company and the product lifecycle, to name two dimensions.

## Where do we go from here?
I'm trying to wrap it up just by answering this question. I believe that the new generation of CTOs (or CPTOs as some companies redefine the role) are driving the evolution of a digital native organisation. More specifically, the evolution of their operating model. Gone are the days when a CTO was required to manage an organisation's technology. Today, a CTO is in a privileged position to capture weak signals and make sense of them. I also recognise that it is not an easy task; it's based on several factors, such as the complexity of the challenge (evolving an operating model), and the demand of the role (yes, still responsible for the digital product).

Today there are more examples of CTOs with this skill and more field stories about the challenges, failures and successes. It is a learnable skill, which I tuned with different professional experiences and knowledge from different communities. Every one of us has a different journey, but in the end, we should create an environment where people enjoy doing their work!
