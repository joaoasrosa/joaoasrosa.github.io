Context: customers ask for DDD workshops on their own domain; goals is to simplife the landscape, or have more innovation
Process: EventStorming -> Contxt Map
Traps: EventStorming exposes the current way of doing things, and Context Maps on top of that gives the same structure as they have today
Solution: Use Wardley Maps, telling people not to think that organisation exists. Just map the purpose space (former problem space). On top of that do a context map, and then compare with the previous one.
CAT: people see the differences, and figure out the path to move between the current situation to a possible future. They even use it to refactor the software architecture, and combines with Team Topologies to enable the organisation to move

Don't forget to add the visuals in each step. In the end is about visual collaboration!
